# LTT 12-in-1 Multi-Bit Ratcheting Screwdriver

## Our ratcheting multi-bit screwdriver features a knurled stainless steel shaft with a strong embedded magnet, internal storage for 12 "shorty" 20mm bits (or 6 full-sized bits), an in-house designed three-lobe handle for comfort and ergonomics, and a tastefully-embossed LTT logo on the end cap.

> The ratchet is based on **Megapro's** long-standing & reliable design, but has been significantly modified to suit our needs. We reversed the ratchet direction (right for clockwise, left for anti-clockwise), adjusted the spring for lighter back-force which allows you to ratchet-drive even very small screws, and optimized for smoothness and quiet function. It's rated for operation of up to `220 inch-pounds` of force.

1. Our bit storage is another collaboration with Megapro. 
2. We utilized their patented bit clip storage design, but adjusted the length of the clips & the size of the total cavity to allow for our smaller, more ergonomic handle.
3. All external plastics are `Triax 1120` - a Nylon and ABS polymer which is great for injection molding parts like ours - for its overall durability and chemical resistance. 

The only exception is the black "accent ring" on the all black versions, which are made from machined Delrin, and the orange "accent ring" on the black & orange version, which are made from injection molded ABS. 

Internal plastics in our ratchet are also made from Delrin for its self-lubricating properties, and our ratchet housing is made from Zinc.

Our industrial-looking black phosphate-coated S2 steel bits are durable and rust resistant.

Standard bit set included with the screwdriver: `PH0, PH1, PH2, H2, H2.5, H4, SL2, SL4, SL6, SQ1, SQ2, and our 5x5 Magnet bit` (affectionately named **"The Screw Retriever"**) (This was previously listed as a `6x6` magnet bit, but that was incorrect. The size is `5x5mm`)

***NOTE: Bits are a consumable item and will wear or break down over time. Visual wear to the black phosphate coating is normal and expected.***
